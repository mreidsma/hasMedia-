#README - hasMedia? Script

---

This tool was developed by Matthew Reidsma in Javascript to display streaming video in CONTENTdm 6.

INSTALLATION

Open hasMedia.js in your favorite text editor and edit the path variable to the path to your CONTENTdm media, and the flashpath variable to the path to your streaming Flash player. That's it! 

Follow the directions on the CONTENTdm website for adding scripts: http://www.contentdm.org/help6/custom/configure11.asp

EXAMPLE:

This tool assumes that you have your media stored in folders named after collections, with the filenames matching the Digital Identifier field. For HTML5 support, you will also need to provide mp4, ogv, and Flash versions of the movies, as wel as a .jpg for the poster. For audio, it assumes .mp3 and .ogg versions for full browser support.

For example, a streaming video for a record in the collection p15035coll11 with a Digital Identifier of ARoberts would have the following files:

* /PATH/TO/CDM/MEDIA/p15035coll11/ARoberts.mp4 - An mp4 for Webkit browsers.
* /PATH/TO/CDM/MEDIA/p15035coll11/ARoberts.ogv - An Ogg Video for Gecko Browsers
* /PATH/TO/CDM/MEDIA/p15035coll11/ARoberts.flv - Flash for non-HTML5 browsers
* /PATH/TO/CDM/MEDIA/p15035coll11/ARoberts.jpg - The poster image to display until the video is played

The script then checks metadata on each single item page for the Type field and whether it contains the phrase "Moving Image" or . If so, it creates the collection variable (in the above example, p15035coll11) as well as the Digital Identifier variable (recordno in the script). It then constructs an HTML5 video or audio block that first serves mp4/mp3 for Webkit browsers, then serves OGG video/OGG audio for Gecko browsers, and finally offers a Flash variant for non-HTML browsers. (It also offers a direct download of the mp4/mp3 for those without HTML5 support or Flash.)
